# colins-game-of-life

A [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) simulation written in JS. 

I wanted to see if I could write the simulation so that it used an infinite 2D plane. I accomplished that, sorta, the grid the game is played on is "infinite" but I only run the simulation for the portion of the world that is in view.
